Preliminary notes
-----------------

The Version 2 of openjpeg has been currently added as a branch on the repository.

All the trunk has been copied and files that needed to change have been patched. In comparison with the trunk, the 'jp3d' directory has been removed because it's based on a modified version of libopenjpeg version 1 and there is no plan to make it reach the version 2 status. Idem with the 'indexer_JPIP', which is obsolete and should be rewritten from scratch.

At the time of the branch creation, the following files and directories have been updated (or added) for version 2 :
* libopenjpeg/
* codec/
* test_Free_image_V2_tile_handling/ : a test program that uses libopenjpeg v2 and libfreeimage (see libs) to implement a basic codec.
* test_V2_tile_handling/ : a test program that generates a random image and (de)compresses it with libopenjpeg v2.
* CMakeLists.txt
* Free_CMakeImport.cmake
* opj_configure.h.in

Other files and directories from the trunk (project files, jpwl/, OPJViewer/, ...) have also been copied in the branch and should be modified progressively to comply with v2. Check the Changelog for updates on this topic.

Enjoy v2 and feel free to contribute !
