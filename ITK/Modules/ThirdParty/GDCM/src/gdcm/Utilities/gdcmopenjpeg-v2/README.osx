Release Notes
--------------
This version of the library has been tested under OSX 10.3 using gcc 3.3.

While the makefiles will make a .dylib and a .a, it is recommended to simply staticly link with the .a file.

Installation
------------
Note: You will need to have root privileges in order to install the library in
/usr/include and /usr/lib directories.
The installation process is as simple as this :
1) Enter the OpenJPEG directory
2) Build the distribution :
make osx
make osxinstall
3) Clean all files produced during the build process
make osxclean

Simple codec compilation
------------------------
Once you've built the library, you might want to test it with a basic codec. To do this, go to the codec directory and either use the provided Makefile or use one of the following commands to build an encoder and decoder respectively:

gcc index.c convert.c image_to_j2k.c -o image_to_j2k -lopenjpeg -I ../libopenjpeg/ -lm -ltiff
gcc index.c convert.c j2k_to_image.c -o j2k_to_image -lopenjpeg -I ../libopenjpeg/ -lm -ltiff

You should add '-L..' to those lines if you did not use the 'install' target (and the 'clean' target neither...).
